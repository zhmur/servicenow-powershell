This PowerShell module provides a series of cmdlets for interacting with the [ServiceNow REST API](http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=REST_API), performed by wrapping `Invoke-RestMethod` for the API calls.  
**IMPORTANT:** Neither this module, nor its creator are in any way affiliated with ServiceNow.

## Requirements
Requires PowerShell 3.0 or above as this is when `Invoke-RestMethod` was introduced.

## Usage
Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Sam-Martin/servicenow-powershell/releases/latest) and  extract the .psm1 and .psd1 files to your PowerShell profile directory (i.e. the `Modules` directory under wherever `$profile` points to in your PS console) and run:  
`Import-Module PSServiceNow`  
Once you've done this, all the cmdlets will be at your disposal, you can see a full list using `Get-Command -Module PSServiceNow`.

### Example - Retrieving an Incident Containing the Word 'PowerShell'
```
Import-Module PSServiceNow
Set-ServiceNowAuth 
Get-ServiceNowIncident -MatchContains @{short_description='PowerShell'} 
```

## Cmdlets  
* Get-ServiceNowChangeRequest
* Get-ServiceNowConfigurationItem
* Get-ServiceNowIncident
* Get-ServiceNowTable
* Get-ServiceNowUser

* New-ServiceNowIncident
* New-ServiceNowQuery
* New-ServiceNowTableEntry
